Gene signature discovery by machine learning

ICGC has clinical data, RNA-seq gene expression data and sequence-based miRNA expression data. We can use matched miRNA expression data and RNA-seq gene expression data to identify potential biomarker for triple negative breast cancer recurrence prognosis and determine if the potential biomarker common across different populations. We biologist would have to identify the relevant clinical information to associated/classify with prognostic RNAs. The computer science aspect of the project would be to use various machine learning classifiers (I guess starting with a simple support vector machine classier) to find the optimal gene set with featured genes that could distinguish different samples apart (recurrent vs non-recurrent).
